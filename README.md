# NixOS Facter

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> **Status: beta**

NixOS Facter aims to be an alternative to projects such as [NixOS Hardware] and [nixos-generate-config].
It solves the problem of bootstrapping [NixOS configurations] by deferring decisions about hardware and other
aspects of the target platform to NixOS modules.

We do this by first generating a machine-readable report (JSON) which captures detailed information about the machine
or virtual environment it was executed within.

This report is then passed to a series of [NixOS modules] which can make a variety of decisions,
some simple, some more complex, enabling things like automatic configuration of network controllers or graphics cards,
USB devices, and so on.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the binary for generating the report.

[NixOS Facter Modules] contains the necessary NixOS modules for making use of the report in a NixOS configuration.

For more information, please see the [docs].

## Quick Start

To generate a report:

```console
# you must run this as root
❯ sudo nix run \
  --option experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
  --option extra-substituters https://numtide.cachix.org \
  --option extra-trusted-public-keys numtide.cachix.org-1:2ps1kLBUWjxIneOy1Ik6cQjb41X0iXVXeHigGmycPPE= \
  github:numtide/nixos-facter -- -o facter.json
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the near-future we will add `nixos-facter` to [nixpkgs]. Until then, we recommend using the [Numtide Binary Cache]
> to avoid having to build everything from scratch.
